# Helpr Angular Challenge

Welcome to the Helpr Angular Challenge. 

The purpose of this exercise is for you to refactor the current code. You are not expected to change any of the existing features of the app. Instead, your solution will be judged based on your ability to:

* write clean code with a focus on performance and simplicity
* provide a solution that is both modular and scalable
* justify your decisions against the current implementation

## Disclaimer

This code does not represent our coding style. The purpose of this exercise is to showcase your ability to improve an existing codebase.

## Instructions

You will need both bower and npm to be able to install the dependencies required for this project.

If you have any question, feel free to send an email to jerome[at]helprapp[dot]io

Good luck!
